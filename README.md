# Space Standards DWG

This GitHub repository supports the OGC Space Standards Domain Working Group.

The Charter of the Space Standards DWG defines the Space Domain as the area above the altitude where atmospheric effects on airborne objects become negligible. Specifically, the area surrounding the Earth at altitudes equal to, or greater than, 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles) above mean sea level*.

The Space Standards Domain Working Group will serve as a forum to identify requirements for standardization which are unique for the Space Domain, identify which organizations (if any) are addressing those requirements, and promote harmonization and integration of shared concepts across all Space standards.

The charter for this DWG is available in both HTML and PDF formats.
